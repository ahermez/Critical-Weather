## Project Title
Critical-Weather

## Description
This project is a City Weather Dashboard that allows users to search for a city and retrieve current and future weather information. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes an API to fetch weather data.

## Features
- City Search: The dashboard provides a tab for users to enter a city name and search for its weather information.

- Current and Future Weather: Upon searching for a city, the dashboard displays the current weather conditions, including wind speed, temperature, and humidity. It also provides future weather forecasts for the next few days.

- API Implementation: The dashboard integrates with a weather API to fetch real-time weather data for the searched city.

- History Tracking: The application has the ability to save the search history locally using local storage. This allows users to view their past searches and quickly access weather information for previously searched cities.

- Event Handling: The dashboard includes click events and event listeners to enable user interaction and trigger weather data retrieval based on user actions.

- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and can adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It provides an optimal viewing experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
